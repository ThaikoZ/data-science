## Introduction

This repository is a collection of data science projects and exercises that I have worked on to enhance my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, showcasing the problem-solving approach, methodology, and results.

## Setup and Installation

To run the notebooks in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThaikoZ/data-science.git
    cd data-science
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
